
# Parallel Matrix Multiplication in Modern C++

This project demonstrates parallel matrix multiplication using `std::thread` in C++. It highlights:
- Concurrency with threads
- Clean and modern syntax (C++17)
- Reusable and scalable design

## Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./MatrixParallel
```

## Output

```
Matrix A x B = 
58 64 
139 154 
```
